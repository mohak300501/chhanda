            <h1>Sanskrit Shloka Making Challenge</h1>
            <p>Namo Namah!<br> Welcome to the Sanskrit Shloka Making Challenge!<br> The aim is to compose a sensible verse in Sanskrit while following the rules of a meter.<br> For this challenge, we shall be using the Anushtubh meter, which is one of the
                easiest and most used meters in Sanskrit poetry. The whole of Ramayana was composed in this meter!<br> There are 12 places in an Anushtubh shloka where the rules of the meter are to be followed, and thus 12 points for metrical correctness.
                8 points will be awarded for the completeness and sense of sentences.<br> We shall not be judging the participants based on grammatical correctness. Neither do you need any expertise in Sanskrit; we have provided to you all the resources
                in links that you will need to create a modest verse. And what's more, code-mixing is allowed!<br> So set your gears in motion, stretch your imagination to the fullest, and get into the rhythm!</p>

            <b>Meter (Chhand - छन्द in Sanskrit)</b>
            <p>A meter is a rhythmic arrangement of syllables in a verse. A specific combination of stressed and unstressed syllables essentially produces a meter. There are over a thousand different meters in Sanskrit!<br> Sanskrit is a phonetic language,
                that is, it's written and spoken forms are equivalent. The vowels are syllables in themselves but can be added to consonants or a group of consonants to create another syllable.<br> Hence, a syllable is associated with one vowel and zero
                or more consonant sounds.</p>

            <b>Stressed and Unstressed Syllables in Sanskrit</b>
            <p>There are two types of vowels in Sanskrit - long and short, and thus long and short syllables. In other words, the two kinds of syllables differ in the times taken to pronounce them. But if a consonant follows a<br> vowel, the syllable becomes
                long, regardless of the vowel's being short or long.<br> Long vowels - अ, इ, उ, ऋ<br> Short vowels - आ, ई, ऊ, ॠ, ए, ऐ, ओ, औ, अं, अः<br> E.g., भानु has two syllables - भा (भ्+आ: long) and नु (न्+उ: short); while देवस्य has three syllables
                - दे (द्+ए: long), वस् (व्+अ+स्: long), and य (य्+अ: short).</p>

            <b>Meter Inspection</b>
            <p>A short syllable is represented by ।.<br> A long syllable is represented by ऽ.<br> An example shloka is inspected as follows -</p>
            <pre style="margin: -2em 0 -4em 0;"><p>
  कलत्रं च पुत्रं च मित्रादि सर्वम्
  । ऽऽ । ऽ ऽ । ऽ ऽ । ऽ ऽ
  मनःशान्तये प्राज्य मुत्सृज्य राज्यम् |
  । ऽ ऽ। ऽ ऽ ।  ऽ ऽ।  ऽ ऽ
  अपूर्वा त्वया दर्शिता त्यागवृत्तिः
  । ऽ ऽ । ऽ ऽ।  ऽ ऽ। ऽऽ
  नमस्ते महाभाग बुद्ध त्रिवारम् ||
  । ऽऽ  ।ऽ ऽ।  ऽ ऽ। ऽ ऽ</p>
			    </pre>
            <p>The arrangement of short and long syllables represents the movement of a snake (।ऽऽ), and thus this meter is named Bhujaṅgaprayātam (भुजङ्गप्रयातम्).</p>

            <b>Anuṣṭup Chhand (अनुष्टुप् छन्द)</b>
            <p>For this game, we shall be using the Anushtup/Anushtubh meter, which is short, simple, and most widely used.<br> The following is a shloka composed in Anushtup and instructing its construction -</p>
            <pre style="margin: -2em 0 -4em 0;"><p>
  श्लोके षष्ठं गुरुज्ञेयम्
   ऽ ऽ ऽऽ । ऽऽ ऽ
  सर्वत्र लघुपञ्चमम्।
   ऽऽ। ।। ऽ। ऽ
  द्विचतुष्पादयोः ह्रस्वम्
   ।। ऽऽ ।ऽ  ऽ ऽ
  सप्तमं दीर्घमन्ययोः।।
   ऽ।ऽ  ऽ। ऽ। ऽ</p>
			    </pre>
            <p>Hence, there are four lines or padas (पद), each consisting of eight syllables.<br>Characteristics of Anushtubh according to the above shloka -<br> 1. The sixth syllable in each pada must be long.<br> 2. The fifth syllable in each pada must
                be short.<br> 3. The seventh syllable must be short in the second and fourth padas, and long in the first and third ones.
            </p>

            <b>Code-mixing</b>
            <p>To make this game more fun, we give you the option of code-mixing; in fact, we encourage you to use your imagination! In case you are unable to find the right word in Sanskrit, you can use an English word, declining it according to Sanskrit
                grammar. But as mentioned before, you WON'T be judged for grammar.<br>E.g., अहं थिङ्कामि - aham thinkaami, that is, 'I am thinking'!</p>

            <b>Directions</b>
            <p>As the rules of the game have already been mentioned, let's brief them, and see how to proceed further -<br> 1. Compose a sensible verse in Anushtubh chhand.<br> 2. Code-mixing allowed, but main focus on Sanskrit.<br> 3. 12 points for meter,
                8 points for sense, 0 points for grammar.<br> 4. Create your shloka in Devanagari script in the textarea below.<br> 5. Use the meter checker to check if your verse follows the meter.<br> 6. Submit!<br> 7. Follow above steps again!! (We
                challenge you ;))</p>

            <b>Resources</b>
            <p>We have provided you with some resources that will aid you in this game -<br> 1. Meter Checker : Use this tool to check if your shloka follows the meter correctly.<br> 2. Sanskrit Dictionary : An easy-to-use comprehensive online dictionary.
                Enter a word either in English or Sanskrit and it will give a list of related words in the other language along wtih their meanings.<br> 3. Pramukh IME : Type in 23 Indian Languages. Downloadable for Android and Windows, or can be used
                online. Note that for Android devices, you can install Sanskrit in Google keyboard.</p>

            <b>Example</b>
            <p>Here is a shloka composed in Anushtubh Chhanda by one of our members. For metrical correctness, this will score 11 points, as the 5th syllable of the last pada is long instead of being short.</p>
